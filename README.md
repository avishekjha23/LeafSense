# LeafSense ðŸŒ¿ â€“ Plant Disease Detection System

This is an AI-powered plant disease detection system that uses deep learning and image classification to identify diseases from leaf images. Built using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), it helps farmers and agricultural professionals detect issues early and take timely action to reduce crop loss.

ðŸš€ Features

- Detects plant leaf diseases using CNN
- Trained on the PlantVillage dataset
- Supports early diagnosis for better crop management
- Real-time classification using color leaf images


ðŸ§  Tech Stack

- Frameworks: TensorFlow, Keras
- Dataset: PlantVillage (Kaggle)
- Libraries: NumPy, OpenCV, Pillow, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn
- Data Augmentation: Keras ImageDataGenerator
- Environment: Google Colab

ðŸ“Š Methodology

- Image preprocessing via normalization and augmentation
- CNN architecture trained and validated on labeled images
- Performance evaluated on unseen data for accuracy and robustness
